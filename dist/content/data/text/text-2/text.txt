#Resumé

####*I am a full stack web engineer with 3 years experience in design, development and deployment of enterprise scale websites.*

<p class="leader">I am passionate about writing maintainable, easy to decipher code using known design patterns that help solve real-life problems. I am a strong believer in writing modular, component based OOP patinated designs, that are extensible and reusable backed with a solid approach to TDD using Mocha/Chai or PHPUnit.</p>

I can use the Adobe CC suite of products proficiently from **Photoshop** and **Illustrator** for designing and **UX development** to **After Effects** and **Premiere** for video spots and editing.

I prefer to use **Affinity Designer** and **Sketch 3** for web development tasks, as **Sketch 3** is perfectly suited for UX design and development cycles.

I enjoy designing usable solutions to problems and then iterate and develop these designs into working solutions from the ground up.

I have extensive working knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**, along with the associated pre and post-processing technologies such as **NPM**, **SASS**, **Grunt**, **Gulp** and **Webpack**. I also have a solid background in the back end technologies **PHP** and **Node**, using frameworks such as **Laravel, Symphony CMS, Kirby and Express/Koa** that interact with RDBMS like **MySQL and NoSQL** systems like **MongoDB** and **CouchDB**. I exclusively use Linux servers/VM’s with Git.

<p class="leader">I specialise in RESTful, API based products using the develop, test, deploy iteration cycle methodology. I am comfortable using the command line with any program that offers a CLI and can write and use scripts to automate useful aspects of repeatable actions and scheduled tasks.</p>

I am an enthusiastic learner, and can pick up new technologies and practices quickly and usefully. I determine their value in the wider picture and developing robust, elegant solutions. Due to the nature of web development, adapting quickly to new changes requires keeping up to date, whilst not getting swept away. I favour experimenting with new technologies and integrating them when they have been proven a suitable solution to a problem rather than using the latest available whether it’s suitable or not.

My personal workflow includes the following:
 - HTML5, CSS3, JS
 - Webpack, SASS & TypeScript
 - sassdoc, jsdoc, typedoc & cssdoc for documentation
 - node.js or kirby CMS
 - mongodb or mysql
 - jasmine
 - github or bitbucket
