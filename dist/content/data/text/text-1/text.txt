#About Me
####I'm a 28 year old full stack engineer living in Shibuya, Tokyo. I'm from Southampton, UK and have been designing and developing websites for 3+ years.

I'm an engineer at [DADI+](http://dadi.co) working on a multitude of clients and services. I also create *things and stuff* in my spare time and have a **keen interest in game development**.

I have extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS including build tools and associated technology. My favourite tool set is Webpack, TypeScript and SASS.

I'm also experienced in back end development using PHP using Laravel, Symphony CMS and Kirby and Node using Express.

I use SQL and NoSQL databases, with my favourites being MySQL and MongoDB, and *nix based servers - mostly Ubuntu.

In my spare time I write simple games using Phaser.js & Unity3D or make [music](http://soundcloud.com/dabby).
