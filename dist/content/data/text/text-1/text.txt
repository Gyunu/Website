#About Me
####I'm a 28 year old full stack engineer living in Shibuya. I'm from sunny Southampton in the UK and have been designing and developing websites for 3+ years.

I'm an engineer at [DADI+](http://dadi.co) working on a multitude of clients and services.

I'm good at HTML, CSS and JS including build tools and other such things. My favourite tool set is Webpack, TypeScript and Sass.

I'm also experienced in back end development using PHP (Laravel, Symphony CMS and Kirby) and Node (Express).

I use SQL and NoSQL databases, with my favourites being MySQL and MongoDB, and *nix based servers - mostly Ubuntu.

In my spare time I write simple games using Phaser.js & Unity3D or make [music](http://soundcloud.com/dabby).
