description:
On this course we covered all aspects of digital design and integration with print based materials.

We used web, mobile and video to experiment in creating convergent campaigns that merged the digital world with the real.

I specialised in video and web design, focussing primarily on video marketing content that ran alongside web campaigns using shot footage, motion graphics and 3D elements.
