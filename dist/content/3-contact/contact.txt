intro:
#Resum√©
####*I'm a full stack web engineer with generous experience in designing, implementing and deploying RESTful services.*

I love designing and creating frameworks, APIs and interface components using primarily node.js based technology on both the front and back end.

My favourite front end stack is SASS and TypeScript using Webpack and custom `npm` build scripts rather than using Grunt or Gulp -- decided after using Grunt and Gulp heavily on projects.

I have notable experience in using PHP, MySQL and Ubuntu to develop and deploy websites, using CMS's such as WordPress, Symphony CMS and Kirby CMS.

I prefer using Laravel 5 and it's ORM Eloquent for back end related tasks.

I'm a fan of test driven development (TDD) using Mocha/Chai and PHPUnit.

My personal workflow includes the following:
 - HTML5, CSS3, JS
 - webpack, SASS, TypeScript
 - sassdoc, jsdoc, tsdoc & cssdoc for documentation
 - node.js or symphony CMS
 - mongodb or mysql
 - mocha/chai & expect
 - github/bitbucket
